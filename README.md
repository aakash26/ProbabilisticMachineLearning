# ProbabilisticMachineLearning
Probablistic Machine Learning course projects related to topic Modelling using LDA, Variational Inference and Autoencoders

**Lab1**: Finding clusters in Twitter data, i.e. grouping tweets with similar content. For this purpose, we first describe a mixture model for categorical data.
Secondly, we use the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to find the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the parameters of our model

**Lab2**: We continue working with the CMM and Twitter data-set presented in Lab 1. We will use different versions of the Gibbs sampling algorithm to find the posterior distribution of the cluster assignments and model parameters
